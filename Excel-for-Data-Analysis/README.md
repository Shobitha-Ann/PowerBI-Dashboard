## Excel Data Analysis - Real-World Example
Introduction
In this project, I explored real-world business questions using Excel's key features, including tables, formulas, PivotTables, charts, slicers, and dynamic arrays. Below is a detailed explanation of the steps I followed for each business question.

## Key Learnings & Implementations
1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding & Using Excel Tables

üìå I learned why Excel tables are crucial for data organization. They provide structured referencing, easy filtering, and auto-expanding functionality when new data is added.

‚úÖ Steps Taken:


- Converted raw data into an Excel Table (Ctrl + T)

- Applied filters and sorting to quickly explore data

- Used structured references instead of regular cell references

2Ô∏è‚É£ Using Total Row & SUBTOTAL Functions

üìå I enabled the Total Row in the table to quickly calculate SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, etc.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Working with Excel Cell References

üìå I explored different types of cell references:

Relative Reference (A1) - Changes when copied

Absolute Reference ($A$1) - Stays fixed

Mixed Reference ($A1 or A$1) - Partially fixed

Spill References - Used with dynamic arrays

‚úÖ Example Formula:

=A2 * B2  ‚Üí (Relative Reference)

=$A$2 * B2  ‚Üí (Mixed Reference)

These concepts helped in formula flexibility and efficiency.

4Ô∏è‚É£ IF / IFS Functions (Bonus Calculation Example)

üìå Bonus Calculation Logic:

If tenure < 3 years ‚Üí 2% bonus
If tenure < 5 years ‚Üí 5% bonus
Else ‚Üí 10% bonus

‚úÖ Formula Used:

=IF([@Tenure]<3,2%, IF([@Tenure]<5, 5%, 10%))* [@salary]


üìå Using the new IFS() function introduced in Excel:


=IFS([@Tenure]<3,2%,[@Tenure]<5, 5%,TRUE, 10%)* [@salary]

The IFS() function simplifies nested IF conditions, making formulas easier to read.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Pivot Tables for Department-wise Summary

üìå I created Pivot Tables to generate a department-wise salary report.

‚úÖ Steps Taken:

- Inserted a Pivot Table (Insert > PivotTable)
- Added Department to the Rows section
- Added Salary to the Values section
- Used SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT for analysis

üìå Issue Faced & Solution:

The PivotTable Fields panel disappeared ‚Üí Fixed by enabling it:

Right-click on Pivot Table ‚Üí Select Show Field List

6Ô∏è‚É£ Using Slicers & Filters for Interactive Analysis

üìå I added Slicers to visually filter PivotTable data based on department and experience level.


‚úÖ Steps Taken:

- Insert > Slicer ‚Üí Selected department coulumn
- Used slicers to quickly filter and analyze data
üìå How to Remove Slicers?

Click on the slicer ‚Üí Press Delete

7Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Box Plots for Salary Distribution

üìå I used Box Plots to analyze salary distribution by gender (Male vs. Female employees).

‚úÖ Steps Taken:


- Selected salary data
- Used Insert > Box Plot 
- Compared salary medians & variations between male and female employees

üìå Key Insights from Box Plot Analysis:

- Identified salary range variations
- Found potential outliers in salary data

2Ô∏è‚É£ The importance of filtering and sorting for data analysis

3Ô∏è‚É£ Cell references (Relative, Absolute, Mixed, Spill) for formulas

4Ô∏è‚É£ IF & IFS functions for logical decision-making

5Ô∏è‚É£ Pivot Tables for summarizing and analyzing data

6Ô∏è‚É£ Slicers for interactive filtering

7Ô∏è‚É£ Box Plots for statistical insights on salary distribution
