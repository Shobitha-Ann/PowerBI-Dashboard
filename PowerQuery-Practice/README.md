## Power Query Projects - Web Scraping & Business Data Analysis
**Introduction**

Power Query is a powerful data transformation tool available in Excel and Power BI. It allows users to connect, transform, and clean data from various sources efficiently. In this project, I explored Power Query by working on two practical examples:

**Web Scraping**: Extracting and dynamically updating data from a website.

**Business Data Analysis**:
 Connecting to a local file, transforming, and analyzing business data.

## Project 1: Web Scraping (2020 Sambar Olympics Medal Table Data)
**Objective**:Extract and analyze 2020 Sambar Olympics medal table data from a website using Power Query in Excel.

**Steps Performed:**

- Connected to a web source using Power Query.

- Extracted the medal table data dynamically to ensure updates when the source changes.

- Transformed the data by cleaning unnecessary columns and formatting.

- Loaded the data into Excel for further analysis.

**Key Learnings:**

- How to connect to a website dynamically.

- How to clean and transform data before analysis.

- How to refresh data automatically when the source is updated.

## Project 2: Business Data Analysis from Local File
**Objective:**
Import and analyze business data stored in an Excel file using Power Query.

**Steps Performed:**

- Connected to a local Excel file using Power Query.

- Extracted and transformed business data, including:

- Filtering specific columns.

- Applying conditional formatting.

- Creating new calculated columns.

- Loaded the transformed data into Excel for further visualization and insights.

**Key Learnings:**

- How to connect Power Query to a local data source.

- How to filter, transform, and structure data efficiently.

- How to optimize data for business analysis.

## Conclusion

By practicing Power Query, I gained hands-on experience in data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). These projects enhanced my ability to clean and analyze data efficiently in Excel, which is essential for a Data Analyst role.

## Next Steps:

- Implement more real-world datasets using Power Query.

- Apply Power Query transformations in Power BI for deeper insights.

- Explore Advanced Power Query functions and M Language.
